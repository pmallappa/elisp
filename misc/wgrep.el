;;; Commentary:

;; wgrep provides to edit grep buffer and to apply the changes to
;; the file.
;;

;;; Install:

;; Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if
;; desired.  And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.
;;
;;     (require 'wgrep)

;; This program is forked version. Original version can be downloaded from
;; http://www.bookshelf.jp/elc/grep-edit.el

;; Following added implementations and differences.
;; * Support grep option -A (--after-context) -B (--before-context)
;; * Some bugfix. (wrong coloring text etc..)
;; * wdired.el like interface.
;; * Remove all advise.
;; * Bind to local variables. (grep-a-lot.el works well)
;; * After save buffer, colored face will be removed.

;; Usage:
;; You can edit the text on *grep* buffer after type C-c C-p.
;; After that the changed text is highlighted.
;; Then, type C-c C-e to apply the highlighting changes
;; to files.

;; Wgrep feature turn-on/turn-off by
;;   M-x wgrep-toggle-feature

;; C-c C-e : apply the highlighting changes to file buffers.
;; C-c C-u : All changes are unmarked and ignored.
;; C-c C-r : Remove the highlight in the region (The Changes doesn't
;; apply to files. Of course, if you type C-c C-e, the remained
;; highlight changes are applied to files.)

;;; History:
;; 

;;; TODO
;; * can undo region.
;; * can remove whole line.
