;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements the support for Sebastian Rose's JavaScript
;; org-info.js to display an Org mode file exported to HTML in an
;; Info-like way, or using folding similar to the outline structure of
;; Org mode itself.

;; Documentation for using this module is in the Org manual.  The
;; script itself is documented by Sebastian Rose in a file distributed
;; with the script.  FIXME: Accurate pointers!
